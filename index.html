           <h3>About Independence Day Of India</h3>
         <p>Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and independent Indian nation.British rule in India began in 1757 when, following the British victory at the Battle of Plassey, the English East India Company began exercising control over the country. The East India Company ruled India for 100 years, until it was replaced by direct British rule (often referred to as the British raj) in the wake of the Indian Mutiny in 1857â€“58. The Indian independence movement began during World War I and was led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who advocated for a peaceful and nonviolent end to British rule.Independence day is celebrated on August 15 on every year.Independence Day is marked throughout India with flag-raising ceremonies, drills, and the singing of the Indian national anthem. Additionally, various cultural programs are made available in the state capitals. After the prime minister participates in the flag-raising ceremony at the Red Fort historic monument in Old Delhi, a parade ensues with members of the armed forces and police. The prime minister then delivers a televised address to the country, recounting the major accomplishments of India during the previous year and outlining future challenges and goals. </p>

           <h3> Unity is Strength!</h3>
           <p>Unity is strength means staying united in all situations. It has a great value in all walks of life. When we are united then we can surmount any challenges and accomplish any goal. The development of our society and country depends on this spirit. In fact civilization came into existence because of the unity among people. In order to lead a peaceful and fulfilling life, it is very important for people to stay united. Unfortunately, this word unity has become confined to motivational and inspirational talks.</p>          
           <p>India was not an independent country till 1947. British had come to India as traders but ruled for 200 years. It was just because of a lack of mutual unity among the people of the country. When the Indians realized that their freedom from the British was a must then they united and fought against the British. Their unity brought independence to India. This example proves that when we work unified then we can bring success.</p>
           <p>India is a multi-cultural, multi-racial, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. It is a land of diversity. People of different religions, customs, cultures and traditions live here. They have their different festivals, fashion and lifestyles. Despite all this variedness, India remains a one-nation. It seems as if the whole country is bound with an invisible common thread. This distinct feature that emerges from this diversity is that in spite of this variedness, they are united.</p>
